problem statement
Sherlock Holmes is working on a case. One day going through evidence, he finds some scribbled text at
corner of victim's diary. Now Sherlock believes that the scribbled text has something to do with the clue
leading to Murderer, so he decides to find every occurrence of all the permutations of the scribbled text in
the entire book. Since this is a huge task, he needs your help, he needs you to figure out if any permutation of
the scribbled text exists in the given text string, so he can save time with the case. Permutation means any
sequence of the string.

1≤T≤100
1 ≤ |Pattern| ≤ 1000
